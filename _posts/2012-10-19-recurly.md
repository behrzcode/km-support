summary: Import your existing Recurly transaction data into KISSmetrics.
---
If you have been using [Recurly][recurly] to track [**transactions**][transactions], you can now import event data about the people who purchased or refunded.


## Integration Details

Event Name | Properties | Identity
-----------| ---------- | --------
`Billed`. Alternatively, if you've [mapped a different event to our "Billed" event][mapping], we'll use this event from your mappings. | `Billing Amount`: (positive transaction amount) | Email address, according to Recurly
`Refunded` | `Billing Amount`: (negative transaction amount) | Email address, according to Recurly

#### Frequency of Import

* We will only import successful purchase transactions.
* Test transactions are omitted.
* We will import historic transaction data from the last 3 years.
* We will check every hour for new transactions.
